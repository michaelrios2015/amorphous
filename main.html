                what am i trying to do<br>
                I don't seem to know I am presumablly tring to get a job..
                am i trying to get a programming job...
                I guess so and if so what does that mean....
                in terms of fullstack it pretty much means i get a front end job
                and for that i have two routes i can learn how to do some algorithms
                which is honestly not terribly hard but does require time and thought
                or i learn how to make a pretty website with node, react and an api
                which is also not super hard but also requires time and thought
            </p>
            <p>
                this is a random html page often called a web page..now with a p
                tag for paragraph honestly not sure yes for paragraph now in a div tag
                div for content divison
            </p>
            <p>
                so this is another paragrah... what am i trying to do here.. not much.. i get
                very annoyed at css and html. which is fairly useless and probably tied to
                frustration over leaving Baltimore, leaving Stephney to die alone and still
                struggling to get a non library job...
            </p>
            <p>
                I mean leaving Stephney to die alone should really be the most important thing
                but you know humans and miscontrued emotions poor little css and html no wonder
                I get mad at it I am asking it to do things it cannot do... you know how about
                we start with the resume page
            </p>

<!-- this returns nothing if started before you would also ussually seperate this into it's own file and just link it here -->
<script>
    // since this is not one thing but an arry like structure
    const h1 = document.getElementsByTagName('header');
    console.log(h1);
    // we splat it out into an array 
    let h1s = [...h1]
    console.log(h1s)
    const p = document.createTextNode('jwdjf;sdlk')
    // h1.appendChild(p)
    // and choose which one to, append chile does need  a node, meaning it's a div, or a p or some such i believe 
    h1s[0].appendChild(p)
