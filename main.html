<body>
    <div>
        <p>
            this is a random html page often called a web page..now with a p
            tag for paragraph honestly not sure yes for paragraph now in a div tag
            div for content divison
        </p>
        <p>
            so this is another paragrah... what am i trying to do here.. not much.. i get
            very annoyed at css and html. which is fairly useless and probably tied to
            frustration over leaving Baltimore, leaving Stephney to die alone and still
            struggling to get a non library job...
        </p>
        <p>
            I mean leaving Stephney to die alone should really be the most important thing
            but you know humans and miscontrued emotions poor little css and html no wonder
            I get mad at it I am asking it to do things it cannot do... you know how about
            we start with the resume page
        </p>
    </div>
